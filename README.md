# Project 3 - Interactive Form 

This project uses JavaScript to add functionality to an HTML form by adding form validation and interactivity such as disabling and enabling form elements based on the user input. To meet the project requirements, jQuery was used singularly. **Aiming for exceeds expectations**.


## Programming Approach

As always, the approach was to break the problems down into as many smaller methods as possible to keep the code DRY and efficient, which will be evident from the code. JQuery was used to interact with the existing HTML DOM elements as well for adding additional paragraph elements to display error messages and a running total of the 'cost' of registering for events. Regex was used for form validation with no additional packages/plugins. The **Extra Credit** requirements were completed to achieve the Exceeds expectations grade.

## Syntax and Conventions

The app is written in ES6 JavaScript and jQuery is used.
